                <p>
                    Hosting is the process of providing server space and resources to make websites, applications, or other online content accessible on the internet. It is a fundamental component of the online infrastructure, enabling individuals and businesses to store and share their digital assets with a global audience.

These servers are connected to the internet, allowing users to access the hosted content through a web browser. Hosting providers offer various types of hosting, including shared hosting, virtual private servers (VPS), dedicated servers, and cloud hosting, each catering to different needs and levels of resource &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;requirements.</p></div>
